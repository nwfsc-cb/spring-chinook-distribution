## Spatial and Temporal Scales

For this new model, we have expanded the spatial scope of them model into the Gulf of Alaska (Fig. \ref{fig:map}).  We have added four new regions in the Gulf of Alaska (WAPEN, EAPEN, NWGOA, NEGOA).  The boundaries for westerly regions (WAPEN,EAPEN,NWGOA) fall along groundfish reporting areas, because virtually all non-terminal recoveries for CWT Chinook salmon in these areas occur in groundfish bycatch. We have data from the shoreside pollock fleets and rockfish trawl fleets in these areas. NEGOA contains a few groundfish recoveries but include the northern-most troll fleet catches (predominantly boats near Yakutat and boats traveling to the Fairweather grounds).  In past work NWGOA troll catches were included in the NSEAK region. All of the other areas are as in Shelton et al. 2021. The total area included in these northerly areas is somewhat larger than the areas off CA and OR, though due to the map projection, not as large as it appears on the plot (Fig. \ref{fig:map}).

```

## Stocks of interest

Information on the stocks and code included can be found in the companion "release-summaries.pdf".  We include non-fall run stocks between the Sacramento river in the south (SFB_wint and SFB_spr) and Taku river in southeast Alaska in the north (NSEAK_Taku_spr). We include stocks with reliable CWT releases and recoveries, with a particular focus on stocks that are used in the Pacific Salmon Commission's CTC model because they have vetted in-river recovery data for a large number of northern stocks.

## Ocean Distribution Estimates

There are several significant differences between the past distribution work and the ocean distribution estimates presented here.  

The first is the domain of the model discussed in the previous section. 

The second is that we have added an additional spatial area (labeled "Offshore" in the figures) in which fish leave the 21 spatial boxes of Fig. \ref{fig:map} and reside outside the reach of the directed and bycatch fisheries described below. Literature and the data motivate the addition of such an offshore box, but allowing fish to disappear our of the model domain causes all sorts of technical difficulties that we will describe later (see next section for a more technical description of the various problems this causes). Due to data availability and estimation reasons, I had to constrain populations from California to southern Oregon to not be present in the offshore box.  All other stocks we allowed to have an estimated proportion of their populations in offshore. For simplicity, I currently have a single season-invariant estimate of the proportion offshore for each stock (i.e. perhaps 20% is offshore in each season). As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:off.dist}, the fraction estimated to be offshore varies substantially among stocks.  Notably, a set of stocks from the interior Columbia and Snake rivers (MCOL_spr, UCOL_spr, SNAK_low_spr, SNAK_up_spr, SNAK_up_sum) are estimated to be almost exclusively outside of the model domain (>90% offshore).  Other stocks within the Columbia basin have very low offshore components (e.g. LCOL_spr, UCOL_spr, WILL_spr) and stocks along the Washington Coast, Puget Sound, Strait of Georgia, and Fraser basin were estimated to have intermediate offshore components, while the northern BC and Alaskan stocks had low offshore proportions. Basically, large offshore proportions mean that CWT from those stocks are very rarely observed in any of the fishing fleets in the ocean.


```{r fig.off.dist,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="\\label{fig:off.dist} Estimates of Winter, Spring and Summer Chinook salmon ocean distributions. ",out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figs-23-07/Offshore Dist P1-pois.pdf")
```
We can combine the offshore and the estimated spatial component within the 21 spatial areas for each season (e.g. Spring, Fig. \ref{fig:spr.dist}; Summer, Fig. \ref{fig:sum.dist}; Fall, Fig. \ref{fig:fall.dist}). In general, these patterns make sense, with southern-origin fish in California and Oregon, many of the of the Puget Sound stocks and southern Canadian stocks spread between Washington and southeastern Alaska, and Northern BC and Alaska stocks in Alaska.  There are some stocks that are spread across a wide swath of the ocean (e.g. NOR_spr, UCOL_sum, FRAS_TH_spr) which is kind of interesting.

There are a few characteristics of this model that I really don't like and am working to remedy. Most importantly, many stocks seem strongly over-represented in the far northern reached of the domain (Western Alaska Peninsula, WAPEN) which not coincidentally is where we only have data from a single, relatively poorly sampled fleet (Alaska pollock).  I have looked at the fits for the observations and predictions in this area and they pretty poor, so I am working on a way to better smooth information among the Gulf of Alaska areas improve the fits and avoid lots of fish hiding in western Alaska. This is mainly a problem for some of the Alaskan and BC stocks, but does influence some of the estimates for the Columbia stocks (e.g. LCOL_spr, UCOL_sum). While this is something to keep in mind when looking at the current estimates, the overall stock distributions will likely not change a lot when I remedy this issue; the WAPEN will likely decline and be redistributed among the other ocean regions roughly proportionally.  So in the figures, all WAPEN will likely become less red, and all of the other areas with light orange color will become slightly darker orange.

The end of this document has a bunch of raw distribution data plotted, if you would like to see the patterns of ocean recoveries for representative releases from particular regions.  See also the separate file that has all of the releases used in the model.

## CWT Releases

I am currently using `r nrow(REL)` releases (one release corresponds to a single hatchery-brood year-release stage combination and may include multiple CWT tag codes) representing `r nrow(x.lab)` distinct groups. I have generally kept the number of groups large thus far and will likely combine them to reduce their number soon. Groups have varying numbers of releases and the number of releases change over time. 

```{r fig.all.releases, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.cap="\\label{fig:all.releases} Number of releases from each origin by year (BY+1 and BY+2)",out.width='100%'}
print(p.all)
```


This suggests that generally I have pretty good coverage for different stocks, but that I should look for a few more PUSO springs, WAC springs and summers, Juan de Fuca springs, lower Fraser springs and summers, and upper Fraser springs (if they exist). Other question marks: HAIDA_sum?

There is also a lot more variability in the release age for these stocks relative to the fall run.  Fish released at BY+1 and BY+2 each make up about half of the releases, and releases have a distinct geographic pattern (Fig. \ref{fig:fing.year.releases})

```{r fig.fing.year.releases, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fing.year.releases} Number of releases from each origin by year (Fingerlings)",fig.dim = c(6,8.5)}
grid.arrange(p.fing,p.year,ncol=1,heights=c(2,2),widths=0.5)

```

Additionally, there are substantial timing differences in when individual runs are released.  Particularly among the yearling releases, more northerly stocks are released later in the spring and after when the ocean model actually starts keeping track of fish (March 1 of BY+2).  This is a minor problem but I think ignorable because all of the releases actually occur during the first season (spring of BY+2).  I want to keep spring of BY+2 because as will be shown below some stocks from the south actually get caught and recovered during those first few months (specifically SFB_winter stocks).



```{r fig.month.release, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="\\label{fig:month.release} Months before ocean model start (red line) CWT releases occur in BY+1 and BY+2",fig.dim=c(6.5,6)}
print(q.month)
```

### Fleets and recoveries

We have added a number of new fleets to the analysis and updated all of the data to include through 2018.

Fleets:

1. **Troll** (recoveries and effort: 1979-2018)
  + Alaska (NEGOA, NSEAK, SSEAK): effort units: landings (different than previous analyses)
  + BC, WA, OR, CA; effort units: boat-days.
  + No troll in western GOA or in Puget Sound (PUSO), no troll in SGEO since 1995.
2. **Treaty Troll** (recoveries and effort: 1979-2018)
  + WAC and SJDF only; effort units: landings
3. **Recreational** (recoveries: 1979 - 2018, effort availability varies)
  + Alaska: no effort data
  + BC: limited / varied effort data until ~ 2002 (units: boat-trips).  Canadian iRec system online starting 2012 (units: license holder trips)
  + WA, OR, CA; effort: angler trips (1979-2018)
4. **At-Sea Hake (ASHOP)** (recoveries and effort: 1991- 2017)
  + WA, OR, CA coast (effort unit: boat-days))
  + Working on updating to 2018
5. **Shoreside Hake** (US recoveries: 2011-2018, effort: 1981-2016)
  + WA, OR, CA (mostly WA, OR; units: boat-days)
  + Working on updating these data
  + BC; effort compiled, but zero recoveries reported for this fleet in RMIS. Canada has CWT recoveries but has never submitted them to RMIS.
6. **GOA Shoreside Pollock** (AK recoveries and effort: 1997 - 2018)
  + WAPEN, EAPEN, NWGOA
  + Very low sampling fractions for this fleet (generally < 10%, many < 5%)
7. **Alaska Shoreside Rockfish** (recoveries and effort: 2011 - 2018)
  + NWGOA and EAPEN only
  + Complete census of Chinook bycatch!
8. **Seine, Gillnet, and Setnet fisheries** (recoveries 1979 - 2018)
  + No effort for any net fisheries.
  + Excluded from analysis.  Mostly very nearshore, mostly terminal fisheries

## Plots of recoveries for selected releases

OK. Let's look at a few representative releases from focal stocks just to get a feel for different ocean distributions.  Plots on the following pages are organized south to north and are pulled at semi-random.  Most are from the 2010 brood year, but some groups don't have a 2010 brood year.  These are raw releases for all gear types included above so they do not explicitly account for fishing effort or catch sampling effort.

For all plots, grey means zero observed recoveries.  Colors mean non-zero recoveries with warmer colors = more recoveries. Note that the colors differe among the panels (so red for the California is not the same as red for one of the upper Columbia stocks)

Short thoughts on results.  

1. You can see massive differences in the recovery locations among stocks. This is not suprising.
2. You can also see massive differences in the overall number of recoveries for stocks (e.g. compare the summer and spring runs for the Upper Columbia (pg. 15))
  + This means we likely have to either implement a new "offshore" box where fish are not susceptible to fisheries or play with selectivity functions.
  + I now have CTC data for many in-river CWT recoveries for some of these stocks and am looking at how to use this info to help inform selectivity and an offshore box.
3. You can see a general trend of older recoveries from south to north.  This is driven by both Chinook retention rules (minimum sizes are larger in the north), size-at-age (fish in the south grow somewhat faster), and later maturation schedules in the north.
  + Will Satterthwaite and I have started looking at including stock-specific size-at-age information for changing the vulnerability to fisheries
