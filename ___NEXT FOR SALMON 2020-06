Long list of things to be added to the Salmon Model

Update circa 04-19-2022
Fix chinook recovery database. (done)
Query spring Chinook recoveries, make basic plots of where and when each is recovered.
Incorporate Alex's edits to fix the spawning calendar.
Add to recovery database.


4-19-2022 Notes
working out of spring-chinook-distribution GitRepo.
Adjusted all_chinook.RData to avoid leading zeros problem.
adjusted releases from 2020_07 to avoid read-in error
Made CWT control files folder.

05/02/2022 Notes
Looked through spr-sum releases. Fixed "01" script so all releases and recoveries were properly dealt with. Added dplyr summary scripts to marine recoveries and debugged some release duplications.  Moved on to mapping recovery locations.  Looked through rec.area.codes
COPPER - only gillnet fisheries (16 fish total).  Will be excluded later.
CISS - more than COPPER but all net fisheries (fishery 20, 28) months - May-Aug. Will be excluded later.
PWS - 49 fish total. all summertime gillnet fisheries. Almost entirely in the Wally Norenberg terminal area...
YAK - lots more recoveries (2448). fisheries = troll (2328 (10) + 45(11)), net(12), rec (60), a handful of test fishery fish (3)
EAPEN - 38 recoveries all from gillnet
NWGOA - 268 recoveries.  All from gillnet

5/3/2022
Looked over the recovery area mapping process.  I kept CISS, PWS, COPPER areas separate for now.  They are all net fisheries and will likely get dropped later. I double checked the mapping to the YAK area for troll fisheries. It looks correct.
I modified some more aggregate functions and moved them to dplyr.
THen I rediscovered Genoa's "Process ALASKA pollock effort.R" file (in the spring-chinook-distribution repo)

5/4-5/5/2022.
Did a deep dive on the CWT and recoveries in the pollock fishery.  Decided to use the CWT files from the observer program in AK because they provide lat-long recoveries and provide a way to isolate which recoveries are from the pollock fleet. There is some complicated matching that occurs between the recovered CWT, observer coverage, and other processes. There are a lot of fish that are included in the pollock fleet because they were collected during a time when the pollock fleet was open and fishing. There remains some questions about whether we should allow recoveries associated with times adjacent to

NEXT. Alaska rockfish fleet. Should be pretty easy.

5/23/2022
Completed all alaskan fisheries, wrote all to file, moved on to the "02_.." file.
Updated beginning of 02 file.
Moved on to recreational fishery data. Updated effort for Puget Sound from pamphlets.
Examined emergency rules for changes to the opening / closing / chinook retention.  Updated WA PUSO Chinook Retention thru 2020. This includes all changes made by emergency rule between 2003 and 2020.
Also updated Chinook size limits on rec fisheries (vuln.rec files).
Updated files are in the Orca_salmon_data folders

5/24/2022-6/17/2022
Ran into some trouble with the Alaska Troll effort files.  Switched from a poor proxy for effort (approximate boat days) to landings.  Double checked the hand troll to power troll conversion (into power-troll equivalents)  using:
[CPUE(Hand) / CPUE(Power)] * Hand_Landings.
Modified the fraction of effort in each month and found some problems in the post 2015 data that was causing negative proportions. Fixed that.  Wrote alaska troll effort to file "effort.data.ak.2022-06.csv" is the file to use in all future analyses.

7/28/22
Finally back to the spring model after getting the OCNMS surveys up and running.
Updated CA, OR, WA troll effort through 2018 (CA) or through 2019 (WA, OR).
Updated and checked code for Treaty Troll fleets
Updated and checked ASHOP and Shoreside fleets. (only data through 2017...)
Began new scripts to read in data from the AK Rockfish and Pollock Shoreside.

8/1/2022-8/10/2022
Worked on many things... Fixed and finished AK effort files (shoreside pollock and rockfish (both CP and shoreside)). Improved and debugged extraction of CWT files for all gear groups.  Fixed recovery area assignments.

8/24/2022
Did a bunch of work for Sean Matson helping out with hake bycatch.  From him I got updated data for CWT recoveries from ASHOP and Shoreside.  I still only have effort data for ASHOP through 2017 and for Shoreside through 2016 (I think).  But now I have the CWT recoveries at least.

9/21/2022
Spent the last few days slogging through the 02... code.  Specifically, I made a number of changes to the processing code (e.g. removed / changed references to reshape2 package).
Requested new, updated data from ASHOP.  Will submit new request to PSMFC soon for shoreside data.
Found problems with the Puget Sound rec data.  Rechecked all of the data I have in hand (1978-80 and 1995-present).  Need to poke at the 1981-1994 data in the UW library.










Fisheries and Effort:
New AK troll effot data
BC hake data
Alaska Pollock
Alaska Rockfish
AK troll- separate inside vs. outside troll
What to do about net fisheries.

Recoveries:
Split out Alaska areas
APEN
KODIAK
CISS
PWS
PWS - inside
YAK

Catchability:
Allow for distinct, run-type Catchability

Spatial boxes:
Add Yakutat and GOA areas.

Vulnerability
Splines and/or Quadratic for rec and troll.

Genetic information
GSI sources
Defining discrete origins in the Model

Maturity
Force all remaining fish to enter the river at age 6 (would likely get rid of need for old age penalty.)---- DONE.
Let Maturity vary from year to year.
Add spring life-history option for spawn timing

Environment
PDO & NPGO as covariates.

OTHER:
TRY OUT ESTIMATING ADULT M with the different mortality schedule.
