#Federal Fisheries Permits (FFP):This permit is required for US vessels used to fish for groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska or Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. 
    #This permit is also required for vessels used to fish for any non-groundfish species and that are required to retain any bycatch of groundfish:

#Federal Processor Permits (FPP):Federal Processor Permits Issued to Shoreside Processors - Federal Processor Permits are also required for shoreside processors that receive and/or process groundfish harvested from Federal waters (or from any Federally-permitted vessels). 
  #FPPs are non-transferable, one-year permits, issued to owners on request and without charge. Also-- Federal Processor Permits Issued to Stationary Floating Processors - This permit is required for stationary floating processors (processing vessels that operate solely within Alaska State waters).
